## An Introduction to Using Python with Microsoft Azure

If you build technical and scientific applications, you're probably familiar with Python. What you might
not know is that there are now tools available that make it easy for you to put your Python applications
on Microsoft Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Microsoft Azure offers a comprehensive set
of services that enable you to quickly build, deploy and manage applications across a global network of
Microsoft-managed data centers. Some of the services that Microsoft Azure offers include blob storage,
databases, and messaging mechanisms such as queues. All Microsoft Azure services are available by
using Python.

Here are some types of activities that you can perform by using Python and Microsoft Azure:
- Remote debugging on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
- Cluster debugging
- Use Python in-line with webpages that you serve.
- Create IPython Notebooks
- Use the Message Passing Library (MPI) for High Performance Computing (HPC).

This article introduces you to two Python development tools. One is the IPython Notebook, which can
be deployed to Linux and Windows virtual machines (VM) on Microsoft Azure. The other is Python Tools
for Visual Studio (PTVS), which is for Windows users. After familiarizing you with the tools, the article
discusses the following topics.

- Tools for developing Python applications on Microsoft Azure
- Deploying an IPython Notebook to Microsoft Azure
- Using Python to create VMs
- Using Python to create an application

**Note**: To use Python with Microsoft Azure, make sure you've downloaded and installed the 
[Python Azure SDK](www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/python/common-tasks/install-python/). 
You also need to have a Microsoft Azure account. For more information about using Python
with Microsoft Azure, go to the [Python Developer Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/python/).

For more details, you can read at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/)
